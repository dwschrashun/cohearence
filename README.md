# Cohearence

Cohearence remembers what users listen to on YouTube, Spotify, Soundcloud, and Bandcamp, and then lets them play back any song they've previously listened to from a source-agnostic player built into a Chrome Extension. 

Users can also playback or manage their playlists and music library from the Cohearence web application, which is synchronized with the extension.

#### 1. Download the [Cohearence Scrobbler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cohearence/jhddmhidckejknknbabaniikacgjhomb/related) from the Chome Web Store</str>
#### 2. Go to [Cohearence.io](www.cohearence.io) and create an account.
#### 3. Log in to the chrome extension with you new account information.
#### 4. Start listening to music!
#### 5. Check out your library, play music back, and make playlists, either by clicking on the extension icon or by visiting [Cohearence.io](www.cohearence.io).
